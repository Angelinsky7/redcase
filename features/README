How to make it work.

1. Edit group :test in Gemfile in the Redmide directory (gems to be added marked by ->, or corse you shouldn't put this arrow )

group :test do
  gem "shoulda", "~> 2.11"
  gem "mocha"
->  gem "cucumber-rails"
->  gem "capybara"
->  gem "database_cleaner"
end

2. Go to Redmine directory and run "bundle install"

3. Runs "rails g cucumber:install"

4. Make a symlink $RAILS_HOME/plugins/redcase/features -> $RAILS_HOME/features

To run unit tests:
"ruby -I test plugins/redcase/test/unit_test.rb"

To run integration tests:
"rake cucumber"
